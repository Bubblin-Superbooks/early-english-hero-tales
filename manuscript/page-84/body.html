Little Finan saw C�dmon go in quietly, for C�dmon was attached to the Abbess Hild's monastery and had a right to go in and eat. Inside they were singing for the sake of mirth, and the torches and firelight were flaming.</p><p>Through the open window&mdash;for windows were always open then, and the word window meant literally "wind-eye"&mdash;Finan saw the harp being passed from one to another.</p><p>They sang many songs as the harp passed from hand to hand, songs of war and songs of home.</p><p>But when the harp was passed to C�dmon, who had charmed the bees, he shook his head sorrowfully, saying that he could not sing, and got up sad and ashamed and went out.</p></div> </div>
