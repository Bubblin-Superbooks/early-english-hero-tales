<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There are four great romantic stories in the Palace of English Literature. The first is King Arthur and the Round Table, which Geoffrey of Monmouth discovered for us by his golden window. The second great romance is the story of Charlemagne. This was in the twelfth century, and the most valiant story which grew out of the Charlemagne Cycle was that of Roland. Every one should know the story of Roland and his famous sword, Durendal. The third is the Lifeof Alexander, which came to England from the east. And the fourth is the Siege of Troy, composed in the thirteenth century and written in Latin.</p><p>It takes many, many stories to satisfy our love of Romance. As we pass through the golden door over which is written Romance, one whole wall is filled with the names of lesser romances forgotten long, long ago.</p></div> </div>
