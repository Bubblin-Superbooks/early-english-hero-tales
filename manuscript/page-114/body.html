<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Besides home-loving poetry, the gleemen sang many religious poems to which the little Alfred listened. Among them was the story of C�dmon, as I have said. We hear, too, of warrior saints, good men who did not go out to slay a fire-spewing dragon lying on a heap of gold, as did Beowulf, but who taught them how to fight the dragon of evil which lurks somewhere near or within us all the time.</p><p>It is this sort of golden and every-day victory that not only C�dmon, the cowherd, sings, but also Cynewulf, who lived during the last half of the eighth century. Cynewulf was a minstrel at the court of one of the Northumbrian kings&mdash;just such a minstrel or gleeman as Alfred sometimes listened to on many a night when he was committing to memory some stirring or beautiful Anglo-Saxon poem.</p></div> </div>
