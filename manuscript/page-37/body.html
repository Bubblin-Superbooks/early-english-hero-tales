<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Beowulf" is a great poem&mdash;English literature knows no poem that is more sacred to it&mdash;but it is a sorrowful poem, too. These people believed in Fate, for Christ had not yet been brought to them with His message of love and peace and joy. English poetry to-day is much more joyous&mdash;because it is Christian poetry&mdash;than it ever could have been if England had remained a heathen land. Yet English poetry still has much in common with "Beowulf," in love of the sea and worship of nature, and a strange sense of Fate.</p><p>But we must close this door over which is written Beowulf, for the Great Palace is full of many doors and many stories, and we have only just begun our journey from golden door to golden door.</p></div> </div>
