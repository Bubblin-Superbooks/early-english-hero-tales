<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Almost more interesting than the stories which C�dmon resung for the world is the story of the way the gift of song came to C�dmon.</p><p>One day a little boy stood by a fishing-boat from which he had just leaped. He dug his toe in the sand and looked up to the edge of the rocky cliff above him.</p><p>"What dost see, lad?" said his uncle, who was tossing his catch of fish to the sand; "creatures of the mist in the clouds yonder?"</p><p>"Nay, uncle," answered Finan, "there is no Grendel in the clouds. Last night at the Hall a man sang to the harp that Grendel was a moor-treader. Also he told of the deeds of the hero Beowulf, and he said that Beowulf had killed Grendel."</p></div> </div>
