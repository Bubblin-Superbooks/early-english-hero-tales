<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Geoffrey's window is a very fascinating place to be&mdash;possibly the most interesting window the world has ever seen. It is not just one lifetime which has found that window interesting, but more lifetimes than we can count comfortably. Sir Thomas Malory, who wrote his Morte d'Arthur in 1469, fairly lived in that window; so did Shakespeare when he wrote "King Lear" in 1605, and even the modern poet, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, who wrote "The Charge of the Light Brigade," composed a series of poems called "Idylls of the King," which return for their sources through Malory to Geoffrey at his window.</p><p>There is one story, however, which Geoffrey did not see as he looked out of his golden window&mdash;the story of the famous kitchen boy, or "Gareth and Linet."</p></div> </div>
