<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>After C�dmon's day there were more and more religious poets. Very often the men who wrote the poetry and prose during the time of C�dmon and of Cuthbert lived in monasteries, where the life was a religious life. In the Great Palace of English Literature there is a pretty story told about Ealdhelm, who was a young man when C�dmon died. This young man later became the Abbot of Malmesbury. He was not only a religious poet, but he also made songs and could sing them to music. He traveled from town to town, and, finding that the men at the fairs did not come to church as they should, he would stand on the bridge and sing songs to them in the English tongue, persuading them thus to come to hear the word of God. Living at this same time&mdash;that is, during the latter half of the seventh century&mdash;was St. Cuthbert, not so great a scholar as Ealdhelm, but as great a wanderer.</p></div> </div>
