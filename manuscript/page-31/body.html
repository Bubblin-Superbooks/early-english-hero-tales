The walls inside were as bright as the roof, and gold-gilded, and the great fires from which smoke poured out through openings in the roof were cheerful and warm.</p><p>Then little Widsith's master was called up, and Widsith placed the harp for him. Clear rose the song from the sc�p's lips, and all the company was still. For a while they forgot the monster which, even now with the falling dusk, was striding up from the sea, perhaps by the same path Beowulf and Widsith and the sc�p had come. Already it had grown dark under heaven and darker in the Hall, and the place was filled with shadowy shapes.</p></div> </div>
