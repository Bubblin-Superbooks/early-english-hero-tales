<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And to mankind since C�dmon, the first English poet, English song has been a beacon to all the world.</p><p>If you open a book written in the English of to-day, it is easy to read it&mdash;just as easy as to understand the speech we use among one another. But the English of fifteen or sixteen hundred years ago would be difficult to read. There is an illustration of this English in a line from "Deor's Lament":</p><p>Thas ofer eode, thisses swa maeg.</p><p>It is easy to pick this out word for word, and see that it means, "That was overcome (or overpassed), so may this be." The English in that Great Palace, some of whose doors are more than twelve hundred years old, is the same English, just as the oak-tree two hundred years old is the same oak-tree, though different, that it was when planted. But you would find it difficult to read the English in which C�dmon wrote his great poems.</p></div> </div>
