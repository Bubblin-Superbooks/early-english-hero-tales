<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> English story-telling, as, for example, Malory's "Morte d'Arthur," could never have been the same without the Norman or French influence. If we pick up a handful of so-called English words, we shall see that some of these words are English, others are French, and still others Latin in their origin. But the Norman spoke French only for a while in England. He soon left the speaking and writing of French for that of English. However, there are many beautiful words, many strong words, many words of customs and manners which we should not find in the Great Palace of English Literature but for the conquerors who came to England.</p><p>There are several manuscripts in which the story of Havelok is found. But the one which is written in an English dialect shows best how old the story is.</p></div> </div>
