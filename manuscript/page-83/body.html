But he knew not of what adventure little Finan was thinking.</p><p>"Aye," he said, "go. Perhaps you will see the blessed Hild."</p><p>So it came about that little Finan climbed the cliff on that evening which was to prove a night wonderful in its miracle.

He went along slowly under the apple-trees. He saw a black-haired Welsh woman draw water.
