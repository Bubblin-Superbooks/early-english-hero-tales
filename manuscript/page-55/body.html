<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It is interesting to think, is it not, that if it had not been for those two little Celtic doors of gold over one of which was written Cymric, or Welsh, and over the other, Gaelic, or Irish, our Great Palace of English Literature could not have been the same palace, nor half so beautiful. It is not only that there would not have been so many wonderful golden doors leading into story-land, but the stories themselves would not have been told in the same way. The Scotch, too, who belong to the Celtic family, are almost as great story-tellers as the Welsh and Irish.</p><p>When the Roman Tacitus wrote about the Welsh and Irish he said, "Their language differs little." And even their buildings, Cï¿½sar said, were "almost similar." What was true of their speech and their buildings was more true of the gifts they have left in the Great Palace.</p></div> </div>
