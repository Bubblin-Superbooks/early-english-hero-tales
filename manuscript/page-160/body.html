You must sacrifice him and sprinkle the foundations with his blood."</p><p>So Vortigern sent men to find a boy who had never had a father and who should be brought him that they might kill him. When Vortigern's messenger reached Caernarvon, thirteen miles away from Beddgelert and the hill Dinas Emrys, they found two boys playing games and quarreling about their parentage. And one of them, Dabutius, was accusing the other, Merlin, of having no father. They took him to Vortigern.</p><p>And Vortigern said, "My magicians told me to seek out a lad who had no father, with whose blood the foundations of my building are to be sprinkled to make it stand."</p></div> </div>
