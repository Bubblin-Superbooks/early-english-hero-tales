But the five rafts that now looked like the tiniest of birds went on drifting out to sea. And the populace, which had been heathens very lately, began to jest at the monks because their prayers were in vain.</p><p>Then said Cuthbert: "Friends, you do wrong to speak evil of those you see hurried away to death.
