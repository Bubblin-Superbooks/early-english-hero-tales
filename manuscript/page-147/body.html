<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> After that these two wicked people were married, while the poor wolf wandered about in the forest, grieving, for he had loved his wife well and truly.</p><p>Some time after this the King was hunting one day in the forest, and his hounds gave chase to a wolf. At last, when the wretched beast was in danger of being overtaken by the hounds and torn into a thousand pieces, he fled to the King, seized him by the stirrup, and licked his foot submissively.</p><p>The King was astonished. He called his companions, and they drove off the dogs, for the King would not have the wolf harmed. But when they started to leave the forest the wolf followed the King and would not be driven away. The King was much pleased, for he had taken a great liking to the wolf. He therefore made a pet of the lonely beast, and at night he slept in the King's own chamber.</p></div> </div>
