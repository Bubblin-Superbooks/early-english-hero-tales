When Grim carried the sack into his cottage, Dame Leve, his wife, was so frightened that she dropped the sack her husband had handed to her, and cracked poor little Havelok's head against a stone.</p><p>They let the boy lie this way until midnight, when it would be dark enough for Grim to drown Havelok in the sea.
