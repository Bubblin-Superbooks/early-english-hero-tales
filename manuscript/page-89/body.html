Therefore went I away from the mirth and came here, for I know not how to sing."</p><p>Again the mysterious stranger spoke. "Yet you could sing."</p><p>And Finan heard the sleep-bound voice of C�dmon ask, "What shall I sing?"</p><p>"Sing to me," said the stranger, "the beginning of all things."</p><p>And at once C�dmon began to sing in a strong voice, and very beautifully, the praise of God who made this world. And his song had all the beat of sea waves in it&mdash;sometimes little waves that lapped gently on the shore and bore in beautiful shells and jeweled seaweed. But more often its rhythm was as mighty as ocean waves that tossed big ships.</p></div> </div>
