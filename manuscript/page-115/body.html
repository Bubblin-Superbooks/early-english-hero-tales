<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This poet-singer loved the sea with all his heart, and his poetry is full of this love. And in our own day, eleven centuries later, Tennyson wrote poems in their spirit not unlike Old English poems. There is one called "The Sailor Boy" which resembles an Anglo-Saxon poem called "The Seafarer." It is a spirited little poem and begins:</p><p>He rose at dawn and, fired with hope, Shot o'er the sultry harbour-bar, And reached the ship and caught the rope, And whistled to the morning star. God help me! save I take my part Of danger on the roaring sea, A devil rises in my heart, Far worse than any death to me.</p></div> </div>
