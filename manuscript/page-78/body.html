<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A very great modern poet, Coleridge, who wrote "The Ancient Mariner," said that prose was words in their best order, but that poetry was the best words in their best order. This is a simple and good definition of poetry. Yet there is even more than best words in their best order in the room beyond the door over which is written Poetry. Perhaps, however, beautiful words in their best order would always teach us to find what is beautiful and to love the good. I do not know. Do you?</p><p>C�dmon's poem, written about 670, marks the beginning of English poetry in Great Britain, for "Beowulf" was first sung in another land&mdash;the land of the conquerors of England&mdash;before it was brought to British soil. The verses of C�dmon's poetry are as stormy as the sea which beats at the bottom of the cliffs of Whitby, on which rose the monastery of Streoneshalh.</p></div> </div>
