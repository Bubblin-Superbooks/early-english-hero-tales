It would have been hard for four men to have carried his huge head, so big it was. The nails of his hands were like iron, and large as the monstrous claws of a wild beast. And, since there was a spell upon him, no sword or spear could harm him.</p><p>While others slept&mdash;even frightened little Widsith, who had thought he could never sleep&mdash;Beowulf lay awake, ready with his naked hands to fight Grendel.</p><p>Suddenly the monster smote the door of Heorot, and it cracked asunder. In he strode, flame in his eyes, and before Beowulf could spring upon him or any one awake, he snatched a sleeping warrior and tore him to pieces.</p></div> </div>
