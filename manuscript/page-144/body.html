<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Marie de France's lays are based on British tradition. There are many of these delightful stories. Among the most interesting of them is "The Werewolf."</p><p>Once upon a time in the days of King Arthur&mdash;for later there are some lines in Malory's "Morte d'Arthur" which tells us that this story must have been true&mdash;there lived a man who for part of the week was a wolf&mdash;that is, he had the form and the appetite of a wolf, and was called a werewolf. But nobody knew that he was a werewolf for three days in the week. Not even his wife, whom he loved well and devotedly, knew what happened to her husband while he was away from her these three days every week.</p></div> </div>
