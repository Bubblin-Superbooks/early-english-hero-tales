<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> C�dmon was at first a servant in this monastery, but when the power to sing came to him it lifted not only C�dmon himself to something better than he had been; it has also lifted men and women ever since to better ways of thinking and feeling and to greater happiness than they would ever have had without English poetry. Bede, who wrote about C�dmon, said, "He did not learn the art of poetry from men, nor of men, but from God." C�dmon sang many songs, chiefly songs about stories in the Bible. Our first poetry was religious. "Dark and true and tender is the north," and true and tender is all great English poetry since that most precious of all the golden doors was thrown open in the Great Palace of English Literature.</p></div> </div>
